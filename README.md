## Zach Graves

I am a data science consultant with a history of applying deep learning tools to a small business setting.

With two engineering degrees and a minor in business, I am interested in the growth and application of artificial intelligence and deep learning in novel and exciting ways.

In my free time, I love to surf, cook, garden, and walk my dog Dood.
